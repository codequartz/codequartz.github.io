            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <img src="fenrir_team.png" alt="picture of gaming company team" width="100" height="100">
            <p>Founded in 2014, Fenrir was a passion project founded by a group of gaming enthusiasts who wanted to
                create a
                platform for players
                to come together and share their love for video games. Our mission is to provide a space where gamers
                from all
                backgrounds can connect, compete, and have fun. </p>
            <p>In its early days, Fenrir started as a small website with a limited selection of games. But as the
                platform grew,
                so did its offerings. Today, Fenrir is a thriving gaming destination with a growing library of popular
                and indie
                games, along with a range of features and services designed to enhance the gaming experience for
                players.</p>
            <p>One of the key factors behind Fenrir's success has been its commitment to building a positive and
                inclusive
                community. From its earliest days, the company has sought to foster a welcoming and respectful culture
                where all
                players can feel comfortable and have fun. This focus on community has been instrumental in attracting a
                diverse
                range of players and building a thriving and engaged community.</p>
            <p>As the gaming industry continues to evolve and grow, Fenrir remains dedicated to its mission of providing
                a space where players can come together to explore, compete, and have fun. Whether you're a seasoned
                gamer
                or just
                starting out, we welcome you to join us on our journey and become a part of the Fenrir community.</p>
